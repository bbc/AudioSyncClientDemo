AudioSync browser demo
======================

"Welcome to our browser-based AudioSync client. It can tell you what radio
station you're tuned to just by listening to it."

It's not designed to be used 'as is' because this repository doesn't contain
the server-side code required to run an AudioSync service. However, we think
this will be an easier way for people to view the client code.


 /javascript/
**************
audio_sync.js is something we've written to act as a client to our AudioSync
web service. To find out how that works, take a look at the web service's
/api endpoint.

We've used a few 3rd party Javascript libraries:
   http://jquery.com/  -  for general cool js stuff
   https://github.com/corbanbrook/dsp.js/  - for FFT in javascript
   http://raphaeljs.com/  -  for easy vector graphics
   http://code.google.com/p/swfobject/  -  to easily embed a swf in a page
  

 /flash/
*********
AudioCapture.as (.swf) captures audio from the system's microphone and uses
ActionScript's ExternalInterface to pass that audio data to Javascript for
processing. We could have done everything in Flash, but we wanted to experiment
with what could be done in HTML5 and Javascript in modern browsers.

Some style sheets to make the client look nice.
